# Project Alpha
Welcome to the ground floor of Project Alpha!
So far, this game will be a true test of craftmanship using web technologies!

## Features:
- Map tile system
- Turn based combat system
- Questing
- Sprite based design
- OOP random gen for weapons/enemies
- Sound effects/Combat Sounds

## Requirements
This project requires a classic MERN setup to use efficiently.
Make sure MongoDB is installed to make use of the backend tools.
Pulling node_modules is needed to get all required dependencies.
Run this in terminal on both ./client and ./server folders:
```
npm install
```
